\modeltable{relative_luminance}{%
{\bf Relative luminance}. The luminance obtained with each model, in
percentage of the zenith luminance, and using the same color scale as in Fig.~6
in~\cite{Zotti2007}. The measurements are interpolated using bicubic spherical
interpolation before being converted to luminance
values.\label{fig:relative_luminance}}{\includegraphics[width=1.5\mytablewidth]{scale_caption}\vspace{-0.5cm}}
